# Summary

In this project, I created a financial dashboard using Tableau. This dashboard also analyzes industy's ESG and looks at their environmental effects through carbon emmissions and water usage. This dashboard analyzes industries over the course of 10 years from 2015-2025.

# Analysis:

ESG: The two lowest average ESG scores for industries were transportation at 46 and energy at 49. It surprised me that energy was not the lowest because its produces the most carbon emmisions and uses the most water by a significant margin. The top two performing industries for ESG scores were Finance at 64 and Technology at 63.

Industry Financial Performance: Technology was by far the most impressive performing industry. It topped every single financial indicator in this dataset. It had the highest revenue, growth rate, profit margin, and a significantly higher market cap than the other industries. Utilities and Transportation on the other hand were disappointing in terms of financial performances. They were in the bottom four of every financial indicator in this dataset.

# Tools:

This project was entirely done on Tableau Public. The main financial dataset is from Kaggle. This dataset is not based on real data as it was synthetically created. The other kaggle dataset I used was for creating a map visualization.

# Map Issues: 

For some reason the map on this dashboard will not show south america. After looking into the data, it seems that the region value for south america is called Latin America. I tried to create a formula that would convert any data from south america to latin america so that the datasets could match, but for some reason it does not work. If anyone has a solution, please let me know. I apologize for the error.
